# SureYouDo.io Contracts

Welcome to the official repository for the SureYouDo.io smart contracts. This repository contains all the Solidity
contracts used to power SureYouDo.io, a decentralized application (DApp) that helps users commit to and achieve their
goals through blockchain technology.

[SureYouDo.io](https://sureyoudo.io) is set to launch on the Polygon network.

## Overview

SureYouDo.io is a Decentralized Application (DApp) that operates on the principle of commitment through staking. Users
set personal or group challenges and targets and lock in a monetary value via smart contracts as a pledge to achieve
those challenges. This unique approach leverages the accountability factor by introducing a financial stake, making the
journey towards achieving goals even more compelling.
